# Prestellation: Jira Data Visualization App Requirements

## Overview
Prestellation is an application designed to extract and visualize Jira data in a condensed, executive-friendly format. The app addresses the limitations of Jira's native reporting capabilities when presenting high-level views across multiple projects for C-level meetings and stakeholder reviews.

## Target Users
The application is designed specifically for management-level stakeholders, not for developers. Primary users include:
- Product Owners
- Project Managers
- Engineering Managers
- Directors and VPs
- C-level Executives

These users need condensed, high-level views of project status and issues across multiple teams for decision-making and stakeholder communications.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Roadmap Visualization

#### 1.1 Quarterly Project Timelines
- Extract and visualize project timelines based on epic progress
- Support for multiple projects in a single view
- Progress indicators for epics and associated tasks

#### 1.2 View Options
- **Milestone/Tile View**:
  - Timeline-based visualization with quarters as organizing principle
  - Tiles representing epics arranged by quarter
  - Side panel for project selection and filtering
  - Color-coded status indicators
  - Completion percentages
  - Visual indication of key milestones

- **List View**: Consolidated view of all project epics in a single screen
  - Comprehensive table with all epics across projects
  - Sortable columns (by project, status, due date, owner)
  - Filterable by quarter, project, status, and owner
  - Quick-view progress indicators

#### 1.3 Filtering and Sorting
- Filter roadmap/epic views by:
  - Projects
  - Owners
  - Time periods (quarter, year)
- Sort capabilities for all columns in list views

### 2. Bug and Issue Reporting

#### 2.1 Severity-Based Reporting
- Count by severity screen with pie chart visualization showing distribution
- Detailed listing of all bugs categorized by severity
- Special focus on critical issues (Sev 1, P0 bugs, critical vulnerabilities)
- Clear indication of bug status (in progress, backlog, etc.)

#### 2.2 Bug Trend Analysis
- Line or bar charts showing bug count trends over time
- Visual indicators for growing or shrinking backlogs
- Comparison views (current period vs. previous periods)

#### 2.3 Recent Issues Tracking
- List of bugs reported in the last 7 days
- Highlighting of new critical issues
- Quick filters for recent issues by severity

#### 2.4 Bug Filtering and Sorting
- Filter bugs by:
  - Priority/Severity
  - Owner/Assignee
  - Project
- Sort capabilities for all columns in bug list views

### 3. General Features

#### 3.1 Data Integration
- Direct integration with Jira API using user credentials
- Secure connection handling with appropriate authentication
- Support for multiple Jira projects/instances
- Automatic data refresh every hour
- Manual sync option for immediate data updates
- Visual indicator showing when data was last refreshed

#### 3.2 Export Capabilities
- Export visualizations and reports to PowerPoint format for executive presentations
- Export reports to PDF format for distribution and archiving
- Ability to select specific sections/views for export
- Maintain formatting and visual elements in exported documents
- Presentation mode for live executive meetings

#### 3.3 User Experience
- Clean, minimalist interface focused on data clarity
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access

#### 3.4 Meeting Actions
- Ability to create action items during review meetings
- Associate actions with specific projects, teams, or individuals
- Track status of action items (open, in progress, completed)
- Notification system for action assignees
- Example use case: VP can create an action for an engineering manager to explain backlog growth after the meeting

## Technical Considerations

### 4.1 Deployment Model
- Web application accessible from standard web browsers
- Responsive design to support desktop and mobile browser access
- No installation required for end users

### 4.2 Configuration and Setup
- Project configuration via environment variables (.env file)
- No admin interface required in initial version
- Consistent treatment of all Jira projects regardless of structure
- Automatic inclusion of all epics from configured projects

### 4.3 Performance and Security
- Authentication with Jira credentials
- Data caching to improve performance
- Regular data refresh to ensure accuracy
- Secure data transmission and storage

### 4.4 Recommended Technical Stack

#### Frontend
- Framework: React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- UI Library: Material-UI or Chakra UI for professional components
- Visualization: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- State Management: Redux or Context API for application state

#### Backend
- Runtime: Node.js with Express.js framework
- API Integration: Axios for Jira API communication
- Caching: Redis for performance optimization
- Authentication: JWT for secure authentication

#### Deployment
- Containerization: Docker for consistent environments
- Hosting: Cloud-based (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated deployment

## Implementation Phases

### 5.1 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The initial release will focus on core functionality only:

#### MVP Features
- Basic roadmap visualization (tile and list views)
- Basic bug reporting with severity-based views
- Direct Jira API integration
- Hourly data refresh
- Simple project configuration via .env file

#### MVP Exclusions
- Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- Export functionality (PowerPoint, PDF)
- Meeting actions feature
- Advanced customization options

### 5.2 Future Phases
- Phase 2: Add filtering, sorting, and export capabilities
- Phase 3: Implement meeting actions feature
- Phase 4: Add advanced customization and user preferences

### 5.3 Non-Functional Requirements
The following are important considerations but not critical for initial release:

- **Performance**: Optimize for reasonable load times and responsiveness
- **Accessibility**: Follow basic web accessibility guidelines
- **Browser Compatibility**: Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile Support**: Ensure basic functionality on tablets and smartphones

These requirements will be addressed iteratively based on user feedback after the initial release.

## Success Criteria
- Reduction in time spent creating executive presentations
- Improved visibility of project status across multiple teams
- More effective communication of critical issues to stakeholders
- Streamlined decision-making process for executive teams
