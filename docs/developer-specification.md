# Prestellation: Developer Specification

## Project Overview

Prestellation is a web application designed to extract and visualize Jira data in a condensed, executive-friendly format. The application addresses the limitations of Jira's native reporting capabilities by providing high-level views across multiple projects for executive presentations, stakeholder reviews, and management decision-making.

### Target Users

The application is designed specifically for management-level stakeholders:
- Product Owners
- Project Managers
- Engineering Managers
- Directors and VPs
- C-level Executives

### Core Value Proposition

Prestellation solves several key problems for management stakeholders:
1. **Time Savings**: Eliminates manual data collection and visualization for executive presentations
2. **Cross-Project Visibility**: Provides unified views across multiple Jira projects
3. **Executive Focus**: Presents only relevant information for decision-makers, not developer details
4. **Critical Issue Tracking**: Highlights high-severity bugs and vulnerabilities across projects
5. **Roadmap Visualization**: Offers timeline-based views of project progress and milestones

## Technical Architecture

### System Architecture

Prestellation follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React.js SPA with Material-UI components
   - Client-side state management with Context API
   - Data visualization using Chart.js
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile access

2. **Backend API Server**
   - Node.js with Express.js framework
   - RESTful API endpoints for data retrieval and processing
   - Jira API integration using Axios
   - Authentication and authorization handling
   - Data caching for performance optimization

3. **External Integrations**
   - Jira Cloud/Server API for data retrieval
   - Authentication via Jira credentials

### Data Flow

1. User authenticates with Jira credentials
2. Backend server retrieves data from Jira API based on configured projects
3. Data is processed, filtered, and transformed on the server
4. Processed data is cached for performance
5. Frontend requests data from backend API endpoints
6. Frontend renders visualizations and reports based on received data
7. User interacts with visualizations and can export reports
