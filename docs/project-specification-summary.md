# Prestellation Project Specification Summary

## Project Overview

Prestellation is a web application designed to extract and visualize Jira data in a condensed, executive-friendly format. The application addresses the limitations of Jira's native reporting capabilities by providing high-level views across multiple projects for executive presentations, stakeholder reviews, and management decision-making.

### Target Users

The application is designed specifically for management-level stakeholders:
- Product Owners
- Project Managers
- Engineering Managers
- Directors and VPs
- C-level Executives

### Core Value Proposition

1. **Time Savings**: Eliminates manual data collection and visualization for executive presentations
2. **Cross-Project Visibility**: Provides unified views across multiple Jira projects
3. **Executive Focus**: Presents only relevant information for decision-makers, not developer details
4. **Critical Issue Tracking**: Highlights high-severity bugs and vulnerabilities across projects
5. **Roadmap Visualization**: Offers timeline-based views of project progress and milestones

## Key Features

### 1. Roadmap Visualization

- **Quarterly View**: Timeline-based visualization with quarters as organizing principle
- **Milestone/Tile View**: Epics represented as tiles arranged by quarter
- **List View**: Tabular representation of roadmap items
- **Filtering**: By project, status, and assignee
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of completion percentages

### 2. Bug Reporting

- **Severity-Based Views**: Dedicated dashboard for high-severity bugs (Sev1/P0)
- **Trend Analysis**: Charts showing bug creation vs. resolution rates
- **Age Indicators**: Highlighting of long-standing issues
- **Project Breakdown**: Bug counts and metrics by project
- **Security Focus**: Special highlighting for security vulnerabilities

### 3. Export Capabilities

- **PowerPoint Export**: Generate presentations from dashboard views
- **PDF Export**: Create formatted reports for distribution
- **Customization**: Select specific visualizations to include
- **Formatting**: Consistent styling and branding

### 4. User Experience

- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design focused on data clarity
- **Responsive Design**: Support for desktop and mobile access
- **Filtering and Search**: Intuitive controls for data exploration
- **Data Freshness**: Visual indicators of last data refresh

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React.js SPA with Material-UI components
   - Client-side state management with Context API
   - Data visualization using Chart.js
   - Responsive design for all devices

2. **Backend API Server**
   - Node.js with Express.js framework
   - RESTful API endpoints for data retrieval
   - Jira API integration using Axios
   - Data caching for performance

3. **External Integrations**
   - Jira Cloud/Server API for data retrieval
   - Authentication via Jira credentials

### Data Flow

1. User authenticates with Jira credentials
2. Backend retrieves data from Jira API
3. Data is processed, filtered, and transformed
4. Frontend requests data from backend API
5. Frontend renders visualizations and reports
6. User interacts with visualizations and exports reports

## Implementation Plan

- **Story 2**: Authentication System
- **Story 3**: Jira API Integration

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

- **Story 4**: Roadmap Visualization - Backend
- **Story 5**: Roadmap Visualization - Frontend
- **Story 6**: Bug Reporting - Backend
- **Story 7**: Bug Reporting - Frontend

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features

- **Story 8**: Export Functionality
- **Story 9**: User Experience Enhancements
- **Story 10**: Performance Optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Levels

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual components and functions
2. **Integration Testing**: API endpoints and service interactions
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user flows and scenarios
4. **Performance Testing**: Response times and resource utilization
5. **Security Testing**: Authentication and vulnerability prevention
6. **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility

### Test Automation

- Continuous integration with automated tests
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Regular performance and security testing

## Data Models

### Core Models

- **Project**: Jira project information
- **Epic**: Large bodies of work spanning multiple issues
- **Issue**: Individual stories, tasks, and bugs
- **User**: Jira user information

### View Models

- **RoadmapViewModel**: Optimized for roadmap visualization
- **BugReportViewModel**: Optimized for bug reporting

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment

- Local development with hot reloading
- Mock Jira API for offline development
- Environment-specific configurations

### Production Environment

- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

- Test coverage > 80%
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### User Metrics

- Reduction in time spent creating executive presentations
- Improved visibility of project status across teams
- More effective communication of critical issues
- Streamlined decision-making process
